# LAM Specification

As LAM's instruction set and scheduler evolves, we'll be specifying the
behavior of individual instructions, groups of them, and the scheduling
behavior in this section of the monorepo.

To run them, make sure to get the TLA+ Toolbox from its
[homepage](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html).
