**LAM** is a lightweight, universal virtual machine for writing scalable and
reliable applications that run natively and on
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org).

It is inspired by [Erlang](https://erlang.org) and
[Lua](https://www.lua.org/start.html), and it is compatible with the [Erlang
VM](https://erlang.org).

LAM lets you reuse the same programming paradigm, known for being
**productive**, across your entire application stack.

server with [Caramel](https://caramel.run))

## Features

* Runs Natively and on WebAssembly -- pick and choose your runtime!
* Easy to Target -- a small and specified bytecode with a text and binary format
* Erlang VM compatibility -- run your existing Erlang, Elixir, Caramel, and Gleam code
* Seamless multi-core -- built to scale from one to thousands of cores for free
* Extreme reliability -- use Erlang's OTP supervision patterns

## Status

Still under heavy development!

There's plenty of work to be done for it to be fully usable, but we keep a few
tracking issues here:

* [LAM Specification Status](https://github.com/AbstractMachinesLab/lam/issues/5)
* [Targetability Status](https://github.com/AbstractMachinesLab/lam/issues/7)
* [WebAssembly and Native Runtime Support](https://github.com/AbstractMachinesLab/lam/issues/8)

The Erlang and Elixir ecosystem compatibility is tracked here:
* [Erlang VM Compatibility Status](https://github.com/AbstractMachinesLab/lam/issues/4)
* [Erlang/Elixir Support Across Runtimes](https://github.com/AbstractMachinesLab/lam/issues/6)
